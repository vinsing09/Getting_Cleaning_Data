#New Variables
Activity - The activity performed while the sensor data was being gathered.

Subject - A numeric value given to the 30 participants in the original study.

The variable names below, although identical to the original variables, are average values over many trials. To avoid confusion I have not prepended mean to the variable name since our original data was mean data. 

#Sensor Data

##Accelerometer & Gyroscope Variables

Our sensor data came from two sensors on the subjects: an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The data recieved from the acceleremeter is noted with "Acc" in the variable name. The data received from the gyroscope is noted with "Gyro"" in the variable name

###Factored Accelerometer & Gyroscope Variables

Sensor data was factored by x, y, z components and futher factored by body and gravity components. For each of these readings a mean and a standard deviation was calculated for the instantaneous case. X, Y and Z appear in the variable name for the corresponding components and "Body" and "Gravity" appear in the variable name to indicate the factor.

##Derived Fields

###Jerk 

Those variables with "Jerk"" in their name are calculated fields, which measure the  acceleration and the angular velocity of the underlying Body x-y-z data. Magnitudes for the jerk are contained in variables with the Mag in the variable name.

###T-prefixed versus F-prefixed variables.

The t-prefixed variables are time domain values. The f-prefixed values are frequency domain values after performing a Fourier transform on the underlying data. Frequency domain means will have a frequency component, indicated by "Freq" in the variable name.
